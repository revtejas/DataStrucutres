# Mathematics: Prime Or Perfect Square Divisors

You are given an integer N.

Find the product of the number of divisors of N which are prime and the number of divisors of N which are perfect squares.
 

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer N.
 
### Sample Input
```
10 -- denotes an integer N
 ```
### Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 105
```

### Output Format
The output contains the product of the number of divisors of N which are prime and the number of divisors of N which are perfect squares.

### Sample Output
```
2
```
 
### Explanation
```
Given: N = 10
The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
The prime divisors are 2, 5 (count = 2).
The perfect square divisors are 1 (count = 1).
Therefore, the output = 2*1 = 2.
