## Array Operations: Difference between X and Y

You have an array of N elements.

Find and print the difference between the Xth and Yth largest elements of the given array. 


### Input Format
The first line contains a single integer N, the size of the array.

The next line contains N space-separated integers i.e. array elements. 

The next line contains two space-separated integers X and Y. 

### Sample Input
```
3
3 1 2
1 3
```

### Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000 

1 <= X <= Y <= N 

1 <= A[i] <= 1000

### Output Format 
Print the required integer in a single line. 

### Sample Output
```
2
```

### Explanation

The 1st greatest element in the array is 3 and the 3rd greatest element in the array is 1. 

Hence, their difference is 3 - 1 = 2.
