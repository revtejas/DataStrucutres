## Why DataStructure and Algorithms
Library, dictionary and closet -> organising is useful -> easier to search

app -> install and uninstall
main reason to uninstall
	storage -> taking so much space
	speed -> taking so much time to respond
mandatory need to look when we develop an app -> I need use space and time efficiently
that's why we are learning ds and algo

## DS
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.Â 


## DS - Types
- Primitive -> only one value -> integers (byte,short, int, long), decimals (double, float), boolean and char
- Non primitive   -> multiple values or collections of values
	- Linear  -> line -> one after other -> Arrays/ArrayList, stack, queue and linkedlist
		- Eg: library, dictionary, biscuit, clothes in closet, color pencils in a box, standing in a line
	- Non Linear -> hiearchical -> trees and graphs
	 	-  Eg: Family tree, Country-States-District tree, folders in computer, dns in internet, google maps

## Array
- Storing only homogenous elmets -> same datatypes
- Continous stored in the memory
- We can access the each element in the array using index
- size is fixed

### When

- there is a problem in which they are asking you to handle collection/group of homogenous elmts
- and size is known

### need to Know
- how to get an size from user 
- how to declare an array
- how to get the array values or elemts
- printing them using for and for each loop
- Click [here](./ArraysDemo.java) to see the code

## Arraylist
- class in the collection framework
- java.util
- dynamic array
- when ? not sure abt size.. also size is increasing after some of point

### need to Know
- how to declare an arraylist
- how to get the arraylist values or elemts
- printing them using for and for each loop
- Click [here](./ArrayListDemo.java) to see the code

## Practice Problems:

1. Print all the even numbers in the array
2. Print all the odd numbers in the array
3. Print all the numbers in the even indices (like 0, 2, 4, 6..) of the array 
4. Print all the numbers in the  odd indices (like 1, 3, 5, 7..) of the array
5. Min and max number in the array

6. Min and max even number in the array

7. Min and max odd number in the array

## Math Class

- java.lang
- mathematical operations
- Input & Output: double
- Math.PI
- **Math.sqrt(81)**
- **Math.pow (2, 3)**
- Math.min(2,3)
- Math.max(2,3)
- Click [here](./MathClassDemo.java) to see the code

# Collections class

- java.util package
- it helper class, gives me some methods that I can work with list,set and queue
- Collections.min(al)
- Collections.max(al)
- Collections.sort(al)
- Collections.sort(al, Collections.reverseOrder())
- Collections.reverse(al)
- Click [here](./CollectionsClassDemo.java) to see the code
