## Array Operations: Maximum Absolute Difference

You are given an array A of integers. You have to find the value of X+Y, where:  

X is the maximum absolute difference between two even elements present in the array, and

Y is the maximum absolute difference between two odd elements present in the array. 

### Note
It is always guaranteed that at least two odd and two even elements will be present.  

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer N denoting the size of the array A

The second line contains N integers denoting the elements of array A.

### Sample Input

7

1 3 6 8 2 6 8

### Constraints
4<= N<=100000 

0<=A[i]<=500 

### Output Format
The output contains a single integer denoting the value of X+Y. 

### Sample Output

8  

### Explanation 
The value of X will be (4-2) = 2.

The value of Y will be (7-1) = 6. 

Hence, the value of x+y will be 2+6 = 8.
