## Sum of factor
 
For a given list of numbers find the its factors and add the factors then if the sum of all factor is present in original list, sort it and print it
 
### Input:

4

6 4 1 8

 
### Output: 

1 6
 
### Explanation:

Factors of 6 =1,2,3 -> sum =6

Factor of 4 = 1,2 -> sum = 3

Factors of 1 = 1  -> sum =1

Factors of 8 = 1,2,4 -> sum = 7

Sums are 6,3,1,7 where 6,1 are present in the list. So, sort it and print it. If the sum is not present in the list then return -1.
