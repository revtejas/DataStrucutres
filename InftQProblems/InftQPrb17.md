# Palindrome String


You are provided with a string of numbers, check whether it is a palindrome or not. If it is not a palindrome, then, reverse the string, add it to the original string and check again. You are required to repeat the process until it becomes palindrome. Find the length of palindromic string. 

**First Input :** String

**Output :** Length of Palindrome

## Sample Testcases :

**I/P 1:**

1

**O/P 1:**

1

**I/P 2:**

145

**O/P 2:**

3

**Explanation :**


Given string is 145, it is not a palindrome. Reversing and adding, 145+541 = 686, Hence it is a palindrome.
