# Pronic number

**Pronic: means it is a multiple of two consecutive integers**

Given a string of random numbers, your job is to find the product of the numbers(one is lesser and one is greater) who is already present in the string. 

For instance, a pronic number is a number which is the product of two consecutive integers, that is, a number of the form n(n + 1). Like 6 is the pronic number as 2*3 = 6.

**First Input :** String of random numbers

**Output :** List of pronic numbers

## Sample Testcases :

**I/P 1:**

123456

**O/P 1:**

2 6 12

**I/P 2:**

4567

**O/P 2:**

-1


## Test Case 1

**Input**

93012630

**Output**

2 6 12 30 930

**Ex:**
6->2*3 it’s a pronic
12->3*4 it’s a pronic

## Test Case 2

**Input:**

12665042

**Output:**
2 6 12 42 650

**Ex:** 
6->2*3 it’s a pronic
12->3*4 it’s a pronic
