## Odd Subarray

Find the number of distinct subarrays in an array of integers such that the sum of elements of subarray should be odd.
Note : Two subarrays are considered different if they either start or end at different index.

### Constraints

1 <= Testcases <= 10 1 <= Size of Array <= 1000

### Input Format :

First line will be an integer T that will denote the number of testcases

For every testcase first line will be an integer N that will denote the size of input array.

Next line will have N values separated with space that will be elements of array.


### Output Format :

Print the number of distinct subarrays for every testcase in a new line.

## Test Case 1

**Input :**

1

3

1 2 3

**Output :** 

4

**Explanation** 

Total subarrays are [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]

In this there is four subarrays which sum is odd i.e: [1],[1,2] ,[2,3],[3].
